# ActivityDetection
I did this project in 2018. I used a preTrain resnet network to learn this network with Kinect Activity Dataset. 
The dataset has some frames videos as each activity every frame has one person with 25 joints with X, Y and Z. 
The network was learned as an image, and coordinated as RGB, and the number of frames is the imageâ€™s width. 
I used Python, PyTorch, scikit-learn, NumPy,  Matplotlib and TensorBoard in PyTorch.
